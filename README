FSConsole

A web-based console for acessing the FreeSWITCH console through a web browser. This code is old
and not guaranteed to work with modern versions of FreeSWITCH, nor with current GWT compilers.

The build/FSConsole.zip file contains the compiled code that you might unzip to your htdocs dir
and open it on a browser straight away.
